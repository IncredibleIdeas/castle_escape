   - Run from command prompt/terminal, not by double-clicking
   - Check Python installation with `python --version`

3. **Input not working**
   - Ensure you're typing commands exactly as shown
   - Press Enter after each command

4. **File not found**
   - Navigate to correct directory using `cd` command
   - Verify file is named `castle_escape.py`

### System Requirements Check

```bash
